- Tests are the live documentation of the code
- Tests never lie since you have to update them each time business logic changes
- Tests help you understand how a piece of code works fast
- Tests help you have confidence when refactoring
- Tests help you quickly check effect of new codes on old ones
- Tests help you have critical thinking while coding and write better code
- Tests can run many times by a computer and save your time
